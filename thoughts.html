          <h2>words of wisdom</h2>
          <p>“How does one become a butterfly?” she asked.<br> “You must want to fly so much that you are willing to
            give up being a caterpillar.”<br>
            “You mean to die?” asked Yellow, remembering the three who fell out of the sky.<br>
            “Yes and no.” he answered. “What looks like you will die, but what’s really you will still live. Life is
            changed, not taken away. Isn’t that different from those who die without ever becoming butterflies?”
            <br>
            <span>Hope for the Flowers by Trina Paulus</span></p>

          <p>“All that you touch you Change. All that you Change changes you. The only lasting truth is Change.”
            <br>
            <span>Parable of the Sower by Octavia E Butler</span></p>

          <p>“People destined to meet will do so, apparently by chance, at precisely the right moment.”
            <br>
            <span>Ralph Waldo Emerson</span></p>

          <p>“It is not beauty that endears, it’s love that makes us see beauty.”
            <br>
            <span>Leo Tolstoy</span></p>

          <p>“We think that the point is to pass the test or overcome the problem, but the truth is that things don't
            really get solved. They come together and they fall apart. Then they come together again and fall apart
            again. It's just like that. The healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen: room for
            grief, for relief, for misery, for joy.”
            <br>
            <span>Pema Chödrön</span></p>

          <p>“He who has contemplated has met with himself, is in a state to see into the realities beyond the surfaces
            of his subject. Nature reveals to him, and, seeing and feeling intensely, he paints, and whether he wills it
            or not each brush stroke is an exact record of such as he was at the exact moment the stroke was made. We
            are not here to do what has already been done.”<br>
            <span>Robert Henri from his book “The Art Spirit”</span></p>

        <div class="left quote" id="heart">
          <h2>words from my heart</h2>
          <p>Love doesn’t equal good times.
            In fact, love is most powerful and needed in sadness and in pain.<br>
            We smile and rejoice when we’re embraced by love even in difficulty and suffering.<br>
            Because love never fails.<br>
            It brings (inner) hope, joy and peace regardless of what’s going on around us.<br>
            No one survives without love.<br>
            With love, one lives on and never dies.<br>
            Without love, it’s not called living. It’s simply time passing by aimlessly.<br>
            All worldly glories and material fortune shall come to pass one day, only love is real and carries on.<br>
            For love never fails.
          </p>

          <p>Life is not always bright and clear. You may see with your eyes and still get lost. You will know your way
            when you feel with your heart.</p>

          <p>We sometimes forget that Love merges our happiness together into an indivisible whole. In Love, there is no
            separation. There is only one eternal consciousness.</p>

          <p>You don’t have to set a big goal, make an elaborate plan, or do something “special” to celebrate life. You
            simply have to be willing to take the steps, to give yourself the opportunity to see what’s in store for
            you. I just realize healing gradually sets in when every day can be both ordinary and extraordinary if you
            choose it.</p>

          <p>See the truth of Life that we are all eternal beings of Light;<br>
            Witness the indestructability of Love and know Love is all that is;<br>
            Live a Life that shines the highest essence of our Being;<br>
            Understand that everything every day is a choice; make choices that align with our true Loving nature;<br>
            Simply Love to become whole again...
